# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is a repository dedicated to common Data Structures and Algorithms 
encountered in computer science.

These are written in the low level language C++.

### Done:
- Algorithms:
    - Searching:
        - Linear-Search
        - Binary-Search
    - Sorting:
        - Bubble-sort
            - Improve narration of process within function
            - Make it a standalone option for user in main and/or automatically run
            when sorted array is required for other algorithms (e.g., binary search;
            perhaps refuse to run binary search before a sorting algorithm is performed?)

<br/>

### To-do:
- Algorithms:
    - Searching:
        - To be determined
    - Sorting:
        - Selection-sort
        - Merge-sort
- Data Structures:
    - Linked list
    - Binary tree
    - Hash table

## Contributions:
- [Luke Fishwick](https://github.com/LucasFishwicas)
    - Done:
        - Added Bubble Sort written in C
        - Refactor Algorithm from C to C++ 
        - Use Bubble Sort in Main (Modified arr to be unsorted)
